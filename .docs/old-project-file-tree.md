4. Plan Filament 4 component architecture based on findings

### Migration Considerations
1. **ACF Fields**: ✅ COMPLETED - All 32 field groups mapped to Laravel/Filament equivalents
2. **Business Logic**: Core classes need to be translated to Laravel services/models
3. **User Roles**: Custom user management suggests role-based permissions

### 📊 ACF Analysis Summary:
- **Entity Management**: 11 main entity forms (Properties, Units, Owners, Tenants, Contracts, Repairs)
- **Reference Data**: 8 lookup tables (Locations, Types, Statuses, Features)
- **Financial System**: 5 payment and financial forms
- **Filter Forms**: 7 advanced search/filter interfaces  
- **Admin Settings**: 3 dashboard and control panel forms

### 🔧 Technical Patterns Identified:
- **Text Fields**: 45+ various text inputs with Arabic labels

## 🔍 CRITICAL USER MANAGEMENT FINDINGS (August 16, 2025)

### 📁 Files Analyzed:
1. **`class-alhiaa-system.php`** - 1,341 lines of core business logic
2. **`class-mange-user.php`** - 10 lines (empty implementation)

### 🎯 Key Business Logic Discovered:

#### Property Ownership Management (Lines 50-80)
- **Automatic property assignment** to owners via `user_property` meta field
- **Ownership transfer logic** when property ownership changes
- **Property cleanup** from previous owner when reassigned
- **Database pattern**: WordPress user_meta storing array of property IDs

#### Role-Based Field Access Control (Lines 412-425)
- **`alh_owner` role** with restricted field access
- **Dynamic field hiding** based on user role
- **Field state control**: readonly/disabled for specific user types
- **Conditional UI**: Different interfaces per user role

### 🏗️ Migration Requirements Identified:

1. **PropertyOwnershipService** - Handle property-to-owner relationships
2. **RoleBasedFieldAccess** - Control field visibility in Filament
3. **User Meta Migration** - Convert WordPress user_meta to Laravel relationships
4. **Custom Filament Components** - Role-aware form fields
5. **Middleware Stack** - Field-level access control

### 📋 Added to Task List:
- Section 2.4 with 7 subsections covering complete user management migration strategy
- Detailed service classes and testing requirements
- Filament-specific implementation notes
- WordPress-to-Laravel migration commands

### 🚨 Priority Actions:
1. **IMMEDIATE**: Implement PropertyOwnershipService before property migration
2. **HIGH**: Set up role-based field access in Filament Resources  
3. **MEDIUM**: Create migration command for user_property meta data
